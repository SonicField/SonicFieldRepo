Version 1.0.2
=============

version 1.0.2: Jan 2017
-----------------------
1) Remove reference counting and move to memory zones.
2) Move more music creation into same file structure and the reset of the source.
3) Improve efficiency of memory management through order of chunk access.
4) Introduce SwapSignal.
5) Fully robust work stealing scheduler.
6) Start of built in support for addative resonant synthesis.

version 1.0.1 Jan 2015
----------------------
1) Hosted on git hub
2) Uses memory mapped files for swap
3) Uses reference counted resource management
4) Addition of FixSignal to normalise magnitude but not remove dc
5) Many other performance enhancements around generators and resource
6) Removal of a lot of old/dead files
7) Move python initialization class definitions to separate file

version 1.0.0
-------------
1) Python as main control language
2) Introduction of generators rather than always creating new data for signals
3) tweaks to the swap file system to handle long signals
4) Raise - rase to a power asymetricallys (unlike Power) 
5) Clean - remote higher requecies via decimation help with avoiding aliasing
6) FFT processing (CrossMultiply, TimeSpace, FrequencySpace)
7) PhaseModulatedSineWave generator
8) Removal of all Spring
9) RestrictedSineWave generator to create slides which are alias free
10) ReadSignal And Write signal for disk based store/retrieve of draw Sonic Field signals
11) Many other small enhancements and tweak


version 0.2.1
-------------
1)  Wave limiting and wave maximizing
2)  Automatic reading in a swapped out signals
3)  Enhanced granular system with bounded random grain size
4)  Performance enhancements in the Do engine
5)  Performance enhancements in the parallelisation drier
6)  More accurate line number reporting in errors
7)  Many minor tweaks
8)  Addition of youtube-voice.sfp single task sfp file
9)  Performance counters are working again
10) Work on granular compression in revoice patchs.sion (0.2) of Sonic Field has many enhancements including but not limited to:

version 0.2
-----------
1)  Granular synthesis
2)  RBJ IIR Filers (high,low,high-shelf,low-shelf,peaking)
3)  Cleaner implementation of resonance synthesis
4)  Better error handling - fix the line number bug
5)  System hang on error in paralleliser bug fixed
6)  Envelope follower.
7)  Fix to numerous bugs in shaped filters
8)  Addition of shaped butterworth and bessel bandpass filters
9)  Improved FM signal modulation and addition of fm signal generator
10) Addition of shaped power
