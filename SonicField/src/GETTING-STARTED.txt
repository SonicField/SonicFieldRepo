To try SFPL simple run the script sfpl in the root directory:
=============================================================

./sython a-patch.py

You will need to create a patch. Please see sonic-field.blogspot.com
for examples of running Sython.

If your machine does not have java 7 on the path, or you do not
have enough RAM to allocate 12Gig or you are on windows, check out
the comments in the sython launch script file to change it appropriately.

Running from Eclipse:
=====================
Simply set up the Eclipse build path based on that in the script file above
then run com.nerdscentral.sfpl.Synthon  passing in jvm and syphon arguments.
